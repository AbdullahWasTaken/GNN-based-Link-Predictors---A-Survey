# GNN based Link Predictors - A Survey
## Jan 2021 â€“ April 2021 | Dr. Sahely Bhadra

 * Surveyed multiple end-to-end Graph Neural Network based link prediction architectures; with encoders as GCN, RGCN, GAT, GraphSAGE and decoders as Inner-Product, Dedicom, DistMult; modeled using PyTorchGeometric
 * Performed benchmarking on Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed datasets; GCN encoder with dedicom based decoders outperformed on all datasets (>2%)
